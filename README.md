The latest version of this addon is for Minecraft v1.21.60.
Currently there are no plans in the future to add support for newer releases. 

The code in this repository is open source and available for working at any time. I believe the BedrockTweaks team was going to run with my code and create updates to their own version.

# MoreMobHeads
Bedrock port of the MoreMobHeads mod pack from VanillaTweaks.

Requires ExtendedLootTables v1.0.2 https://github.com/gyver5681/ExtendedLootTables/releases/tag/V1.0.2
